# Problem:
#
# Write a function, breaking_boundaries, that takes in 5 arguments:
# a number of rows (m), a number of columns (n), a number of moves (k), a starting row (r), and a starting column (c).
# Say you were situated in a grid with dimensions m * n. If you had to start at position (r,c),
# in how many different ways could you move out of bounds if you could take at most k moves.
#
# A single move is moving one space up, down, left, or right. During a path you may revisit a position.
