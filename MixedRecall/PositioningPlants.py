# Problem:
#
# You've been hired to plant flowers in a garden with n different positions. There are m different flower types.
# The prices of flowers types vary depending on which position they are planted.
# Your bosses are picky, they tell you to never plant two of the same flower type right next to each other.
# What is the minimum cost we need to plant a flower in each position of the garden?
#
# Write a function, positioningPlants, that takes in a 2D list with dimensions n * m.
# Each row of the list represents the costs of the flower types at that position.
# This means that costs[i][j] represents the cost of planting flower type j at position i.
#
# For example:
#
# Given these costs,
#
# costs = [
#   [4, 3, 7],
#   [6, 1, 9],
#   [2, 5, 3]
# ]
#
# The costs of plants at position 1 are $6, $1, and $9.
# The cost of planting flower type 0 at position 1 is $6.
# The cost of planting flower type 2 at position 1 is $9.
